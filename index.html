        The Jesuit Fathers and Brothers, in collaboration with a competent and dedicated
        lay staff, run St. Xavier’s School. Founded by St. lgnatius Loyola in the 16th century,
        the Society of Jesus has been associated with education" throughout the world and
        notably in India. Since the earliest history Jesuit education has been inspired
        by a vision of man drawn from the life and teachings of Jesus Christ who has always
        been respected and admired by the people of India. St. Francis Xavier arrived in
        India in 1541. He died off the China coast in 1552. Amidst his almost incredible
        journeying in India and as far as Japan and the “Spice Island” or Eastern Indonesia,
        carrying Christ’s message of divine love and mercy, he found time to organize the
        first Jesuit school in India, His name lives on today in many schools, colleges
        and institutes of advanced training throughout the subcontinent just as his example
        of self-sacrificing love continues to inspire his fellow Jesuits.
        <br />
        Founded in 1940, St. Xavier’s is meant primarily for Catholics but is open to all,
        irrespective of religion, caste or community who would be trained to lead lives
        in keeping with the school motto For God and Country. Through the years it has built
        up a reputation for excellence in the education it imparts to boys/girls from in
        and around Patna. Its earnest intent is that the young men/women it prepares for
        the world may be able to distinguish themselves by their selfless service, a service
        inspired by the reality that as children of one Father we are all brothers and sisters
        responsible for one another. As an institution, St. Xavier’s continually strives
        to adapt itself to the needs and aspirations of the people among whom it works.
        Students will be admitted in as long as they show promise of becoming young men/women
        and citizens who will live up to the school’s aims and ideals.
